# TransBorderFreight Data Analysis

This project analyses transportation data from the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)** to uncover insights into cross-border freight's efficiency, safety and environmental impacts across modes such as road, rail, air and water.

## Objectives
- **Freight Patterns**: Identify trends in freight volume, routing, and modes of transport.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Detect inefficiencies and propose resource optimisation strategies.
- **Environmental Impact**: Assess emissions and fuel usage, recommending sustainability improvements.
- **Safety Analysis**: Evaluate incidents and suggest safety protocol enhancements.
- **Economic Effects**: Analyse the impact of trade patterns, policies and global disruptions.
- **Data-Driven Solutions**: Provide actionable recommendations for improving freight systems.

## Methodology
The analysis follows the **CRISP-DM** framework:
1. Business Understanding: Defining the project objectives and data-related goals.
2. Data Understanding: Exploring and assessing the quality of the data.
3. Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
4. Modelling: Applying analytical and machine learning techniques (where applicable).
5. Evaluation: Interpreting results and validating insights.
6. Deployment: Communicating findings and actionable strategies to stakeholders.

## Tools
- **R**: Data analysis and visualisation.
- **Git**: Version control.

## Outcomes
- Insights into freight trends and inefficiencies.
- Strategies for sustainability, safety and system performance improvement.
- Data visualisations for effective communication.
