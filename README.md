# TransBorderFreight Data Analysis

This project analyses transportation data from the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)** to uncover insights into cross-border freight's efficiency, safety and environmental impacts across modes such as road, rail, air and water.

## Objectives
- **Freight Patterns**: Identify trends in freight volume, routing, and modes of transport.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Detect inefficiencies and propose resource optimisation strategies.
- **Environmental Impact**: Assess emissions and fuel usage, recommending sustainability improvements.
- **Safety Analysis**: Evaluate incidents and suggest safety protocol enhancements.
- **Economic Effects**: Analyse the impact of trade patterns, policies and global disruptions.
- **Data-Driven Solutions**: Provide actionable recommendations for improving freight systems.

## Methodology
The analysis follows the **CRISP-DM** framework:
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

## Tools
- **R**: Data analysis and visualisation.
- **Git**: Version control.

## Outcomes
- Insights into freight trends and inefficiencies.
- Strategies for sustainability, safety and system performance improvement.
